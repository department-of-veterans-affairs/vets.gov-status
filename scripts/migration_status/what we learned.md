#### Draft Ideas

### Kelly
- Need application level SLAs
- Programs / porfolios of projects should be grouped together (one VIPR ID) for reporting rollup
- Tools: need a Jira type of tool for back end ticketing, scope management, and reporting
- Intake (Ken's team); unclear if this is being used?
- what does "complete" mean? if a system is in prod w/ no users is it done?
